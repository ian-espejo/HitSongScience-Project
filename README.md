# HitSongScience-Project
This project explores Spotify's song popularity prediction testing five machine learning techniques. The dataset comes from Kaggle's 'Data on Songs from Billboard 1999-2019', which contains the Spotify for Developers' audio features for 154,931 songs. Ten of this variables are used for the predictive model, with a binary outcome variable for Hit/No-Hit classification, according to a cut made in the discrete popularity variable. The highest accuracy was achieved by random forest (86.8%), with high sensitivity (0.99) but low specificity (0.08) in the model.
